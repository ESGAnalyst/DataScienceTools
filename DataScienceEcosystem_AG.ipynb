I took a C programming class in college may year agao, but not C++\n## Difficulty\nJava is the next most difficult then JavaScript. \nThe above 3 are languages people typically learn as SW developers and progammers in school.\nR, Python and Julia are easier to learn and people without programming degrees, but who work in data analysis, such as policy analysts and financial analysts often learn them. \nR is considered harder than Python, however, the syntax felt a bit more intuitive to me. \n## Other Languages\nSome additional languages are SQL, which is used in Tableau and Access as a search and query tool, SAS, Scale and Perl",

Looking at my notes, I see that TensorFlow is a deeplearning library as is Scikit-learn, PyTorch and Keras. I didn't work with those yet.\n## R \nIn R Studio, the library I used were ggplot2 (parallel to Matplotlib datavisualization) and Plotly, which is also used with python. Ididn't wind up loading Dplyr in R Studio practice, which is the R equivalent of Pandas. I also used GGally which adds to the ggplot function with pairing, but I had to install and load some dependencies before I could load GGally - Patchwork, Broom helpers and GGStats. \n## Other\nLooking at my notes I see that Apache spark has its own Spark Library with similar functionality as Pandas, NumPy and Scikit-learn\nScala has its own libraries as well. I didn't work with Scale in this course, so not familiar with those.",
